# JASigningInterface
Designing a user-friendly interface that allows users to select an English phrase and outputs an  ASL signing avatar animation generated by JASigning.

The goal is to design a web-page that is user-friendly and applies specifically to retail settings. There will eventually be multiple versions in which users can select a different environment (i.e. coffee shop, clothing store, etc.)

Animations were generated using the JASigning video generator: https://vh.cmp.uea.ac.uk/index.php/JASigning_Video_Generator

Project duration: September 1st, 2023 - May 4th, 2024
